Sure! Here is the explanation rewritten using LaTeX markdown:

Consider the equation:
$$\sin(x) \cos(x) = 0$$

Let's solve this equation step by step without losing solutions first:

1. **Using the [[Zero Product Theorem]]**: 
   \[ \sin(x) \cos(x) = 0 \]
   This means either:
   \[ \sin(x) = 0 \]
   or
   \[ \cos(x) = 0 \]

2. **Solving for \( \sin(x) = 0 \)**:
   \[ x = n\pi \]
   where \( n \) is any integer.

3. **Solving for \( \cos(x) = 0 \)**:
   \[ x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \]
   where \( k \) is any integer.

Combining these solutions, the complete set of solutions is:
\[ x = n\pi \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \]
where \( n \) and \( k \) are any integers.

Now, let's see what happens if we divide both sides of the equation by \(\cos(x)\):

\[ \sin(x) \cos(x) = 0 \]
Dividing both sides by \(\cos(x)\):
\[ \sin(x) = 0 \]
(Note: This step is only valid if \(\cos(x) \neq 0\))

Solving \(\sin(x) = 0\):
\[ x = n\pi \]

By dividing by \(\cos(x)\), we have implicitly assumed \(\cos(x) \neq 0\), thus we miss the solutions where \(\cos(x) = 0\) (i.e., \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \)).

Thus, the solutions \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \) are lost when we divide by \(\cos(x)\). 

In conclusion, dividing by a trigonometric function can cause the loss of solutions corresponding to the zeros of the function we divided by.
