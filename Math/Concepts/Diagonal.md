As applied to a polygon, a diagonal is a line segment joining any two non-consecutive vertices. For any convex polygon, all the diagonals are inside the polygon. Any n-sided polygon ($n \geq 3$), convex or concave, has $_nC_2 - n = \frac{\displaystyle n!}{\displaystyle 2!(n-2)!} - n = \frac{\displaystyle n(n-1)}{\displaystyle 2} -n = {\displaystyle {\frac {n(n-3)}{2}}}$ total diagonals, as each vertex has \frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} diagonals to all other vertices except itself and the two adjacent vertices, or $n âˆ’ 3$ diagonals, and each diagonal is shared by two vertices.
