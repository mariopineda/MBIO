Transcendental functions are a class of functions that cannot be expressed as finite combinations of algebraic operations (addition, multiplication, and root extraction) on their variables. These functions go beyond algebraic functions, which include polynomials and rational functions. Here are some key examples and properties of transcendental functions:

### Examples of Transcendental Functions
1. **Exponential Functions:** $e^x$, $a^x$ (where $a$ is a positive constant)
2. **Logarithmic Functions:** $\log(x)$, $\ln(x)$
3. **Trigonometric Functions:** $\sin(x)$, $\cos(x)$, $\tan(x)$
4. **Inverse Trigonometric Functions:** $\arcsin(x)$, $\arccos(x)$, $\arctan(x)$
