In mathematics, particularly in mathematical writing and typesetting, a "tombstone" is a symbol used to signify the end of a proof. It is also known as a "halmos," named after the mathematician Paul Halmos who popularized its use. The tombstone symbol looks like a small solid square (■), and it is placed at the end of the final statement of a proof to indicate that the proof is complete. Sometimes, it can also appear as a hollow square (□) or simply as [[QED|"Q.E.D."]] (an abbreviation of the Latin phrase "quod erat demonstrandum," meaning "which was to be demonstrated").

Here's an example:

Proof:
Suppose \( x = y \).
Then, by the definition of equality, \( x + z = y + z \) for any \( z \).
Therefore, if \( z = 0 \), we have \( x + 0 = y + 0 \), which simplifies to \( x = y \).

In LaTeX, a common typesetting system for mathematical documents, the tombstone can be produced using the command `\qed` or `\blacksquare` for a solid black square.
