**Slide 2: Objectives**
- Understand the basics of counting methods in combinatorics
- Learn about the fundamental principles of counting
- Explore permutations and combinations
- Apply counting methods to solve practical problems
---
**Slide 3: Importance of Counting Methods**
- Counting methods are essential in various fields such as mathematics, computer science, statistics, and probability.
- They help in solving problems related to arranging, selecting, and distributing objects.
- Foundation for more advanced topics like probability theory and statistical analysis.
---
**Slide 4: Basic Principles of Counting**
- **The Addition Principle**: If there are \(a\) ways to do something and \(b\) ways to do another thing, and the two actions cannot be done at the same time, there are \(a + b\) ways to choose one of the actions.
  - Example: Choosing between 3 types of sandwiches and 4 types of salads.
- **The Multiplication Principle**: If there are \(a\) ways to do something and \(b\) ways to do another thing after that, there are \(a \times b\) ways to do both actions.
  - Example: Choosing an outfit (3 shirts and 4 pants).
---
**Slide 5: Permutations**
- Definition: An arrangement of objects in a specific order.
- Formula: \( P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \)
  - Where \( n \) is the total number of objects, \( r \) is the number of objects to arrange, and \( n! \) is the factorial of \( n \).
- Example: Arranging 3 out of 5 books on a shelf.

**Slide 6: Permutations Example**
- Example Problem: How many ways can you arrange 3 out of 5 books on a shelf?
  - Solution: \( P(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{2!} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \) ways.

**Slide 7: Combinations**
- Definition: A selection of objects where the order does not matter.
- Formula: \( C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \)
  - Where \( n \) is the total number of objects, \( r \) is the number of objects to choose, and \( n! \) is the factorial of \( n \).
- Example: Choosing 3 out of 5 fruits.

**Slide 8: Combinations Example**
- Example Problem: How many ways can you choose 3 out of 5 fruits?
  - Solution: \( C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = 10 \) ways.

**Slide 9: Applications of Counting Methods**
- **Probability**: Calculating the likelihood of events.
- **Statistics**: Sampling methods and data analysis.
- **Computer Science**: Algorithms and data structures.
- **Game Theory**: Strategy formulation.

**Slide 10: Practice Problems**
1. How many ways can you arrange 4 out of 7 letters?
2. How many ways can you choose 2 out of 6 colors?
3. In how many ways can a committee of 3 be formed from 8 people?

**Slide 11: Solutions to Practice Problems**
1. \( P(7, 4) = \frac{7!}{(7-4)!} = 840 \)
2. \( C(6, 2) = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = 15 \)
3. \( C(8, 3) = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = 56 \)

**Slide 12: Advanced Counting Techniques**
- **The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**: Used to count the number of elements in the union of overlapping sets.
- **Pigeonhole Principle**: If more items are put into fewer containers than there are items, at least one container must contain more than one item.
- **Generating Functions**: Encodes sequences and allows manipulation to solve counting problems.

**Slide 13: Summary**
- Review of basic counting principles: addition and multiplication.
