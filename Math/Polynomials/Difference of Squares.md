The difference of squares is a specific algebraic pattern that can be factored using a straightforward formula. It involves expressions of the form \(a^2 - b^2\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are any expressions.

### Formula

The difference of squares can be factored as:
\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b) \]

### Why This Works

To understand why this factorization works, let's expand the right-hand side:
\[ (a + b)(a - b) \]

Using the distributive property (FOIL method for binomials):
\[ (a + b)(a - b) = a(a) + a(-b) + b(a) + b(-b) \]
\[ = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2 \]

Notice that the middle terms, \(-ab\) and \(+ab\), cancel each other out:
\[ = a^2 - b^2 \]

So, we see that:
\[ (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \]

### Examples

1. **Basic Example**:
   Factor \(x^2 - 9\).

   Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = 3\) because \(9\) is \(3^2\).
   \[ x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3) \]

2. **More Complex Example**:
   Factor \(4x^2 - 25\).

   Here, \(a = 2x\) and \(b = 5\) because \(4x^2\) is \((2x)^2\) and \(25\) is \(5^2\).
   \[ 4x^2 - 25 = (2x + 5)(2x - 5) \]

3. **Example with Variables and Constants**:
   Factor \(x^2 - y^2\).

   Here, \(a = x\) and \(b = y\).
   \[ x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) \]

### Recognizing the Pattern

To identify a difference of squares, look for two terms:
1. Each term must be a perfect square (something squared).
2. There is a subtraction (difference) between them.

### Why It's Useful

Factoring the difference of squares is useful in simplifying expressions, solving equations, and in calculus for integrating certain functions. It is a common technique used in algebra to simplify expressions and to solve quadratic equations that take this specific form.

### Practice Problem

Factor \(9x^2 - 16\).

1. Recognize that \(9x^2 = (3x)^2\) and \(16 = 4^2\).
2. Apply the difference of squares formula:
   \[ 9x^2 - 16 = (3x + 4)(3x - 4) \]

This simple pattern makes factoring quicker and helps in recognizing special structures in algebraic expressions.
