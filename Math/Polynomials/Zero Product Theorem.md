> [! abstract] Zero Product Theorem
If the product of two numbers is zero, then at least one of the numbers must be zero.

If $A$ and $B$ are numbers, and $A \cdot B = 0$ then either $A = 0$ or $B = 0$ or both.

### Example

Suppose we have the equation:
\[ x(x - 3) = 0 \]

To solve this using the Zero Product Theorem, we set each factor to zero:
\[ x = 0 \]
or
\[ x - 3 = 0 \]

Solving these gives the solutions:
\[ x = 0 \]
or
\[ x = 3 \]

So, the solutions to the equation \( x(x - 3) = 0 \) are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 3 \).

### Application to Trigonometric Equations

When we have a trigonometric equation like:
\[ \sin(x) \cos(x) = 0 \]

We use the Zero Product Theorem to solve it. According to the theorem, for the product to be zero, one or both of the factors must be zero:
\[ \sin(x) = 0 \]
or
\[ \cos(x) = 0 \]

Then, we solve each of these equations separately:
- \( \sin(x) = 0 \) gives solutions \( x = n\pi \) (where \( n \) is any integer).
- \( \cos(x) = 0 \) gives solutions \( x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \) (where \( k \) is any integer).

Thus, using the Zero Product Theorem helps us find all the solutions to the equation.
