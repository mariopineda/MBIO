A stone is tossed upward with a velocity of 8 m/s from the edge of a cliff 63 m high. How long will it take the stone to hit the ground at the foot of the cliff? Assume the gravitational constant is 9.8 m/s$^2$.

v = -9.8t + 8

Since  $h(t)$ is the position-time function, $\frac{\displaystyle dh}{\displaystyle dt} = v$, 
>$$
\frac{dh}{dt} = -9.8t + 8
>$$
where the antiderivative is 
>$$
h(t) = -4.9t^2 +8t + h_0
>$$
where $h_0 = 63$ is the initial position, hence
>$$
h(t) = -4.9t^2 +8t + 63
>$$
We can now answer the questions. The stone hits the ground when  $h(t)=0$, hence
>$$
h(t)=0 \Rightarrow -4.9t^2 + 8t + 63 = 0
>$$
Using the quadratic formula we obtain the roots
>$$
t = \frac{-8 + \sqrt{8^2-4(-4.9)(63)}}{-9.8} = -2.86
>$$
and 
>$$
t = \frac{-8 - \sqrt{8^2-4(-4.9)(63)}}{-9.8} = 4.49
>$$
Because the negative root has no physical significance in this problem, we see that about 4.5 s after being tossed up the stone hits the ground.
