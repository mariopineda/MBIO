> The first few derivatives of $\sin(7x)$ with respect to $x$ are:
> 
> 1st derivative: $y\prime = 7\cos(7x)$
> 2nd derivative: $y\prime\prime = -7^2\sin(7x)$
> 3rd derivative: $y\prime\prime\prime = -7^3\cos(7x)$
> 4rd derivative: $y^{(4)} = 7^4\cos(7x)$
> 5rd derivative: $y^{(5)} = -7^5\cos(7x)$
> 
> From this pattern, we can see that the 101st derivative will have a sinusoidal term, and since we differentiate sinusoidal functions, we alternate between sine and cosine, and each time we differentiate, the coefficient gets multiplied by $-7^2 = -49$. Since 101 is odd, the 101st derivative will have a sine term.
