> To find the 101st derivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\), we can use the fact that the derivative of \(\sin(x)\) cycles between \(\sin(x)\) and \(-\cos(x)\) every four derivatives. Since 101 is 1 more than a multiple of 4, we will start with the first derivative and observe the pattern:
> 
> 1st derivative: \(\cos(x)\)
> 5th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 9th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 13th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 17th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 21st derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 25th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 29th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 33rd derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 37th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 41st derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 45th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 49th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 53rd derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 57th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 61st derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 65th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 69th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 73rd derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 77th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 81st derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 85th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 89th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 93rd derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 97th derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 101st derivative: \(-\cos(x)\)
> 
> So, the 101st derivative of \(f(x) = \sin(x)\) is \(-\cos(x)\).
