> To find the 27th derivative of $\cos(x)$, we can utilize the fact that the derivative of $\cos(x)$ cycles between $\cos(x)$ and $-\sin(x)$ every four derivatives. Since 27 is not a multiple of 4, we know that the 27th derivative will involve both $\cos(x)$ and $\sin(x)$ terms.

> 15th derivative: $\sin(x)$
> 19th derivative: $\sin(x)$
> 23rd derivative: $\sin(x)$
> 27th derivative: $\sin(x)$

> So, the 27th derivative of $\cos(x)$ is $\sin(x)$.
