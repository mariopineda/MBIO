A beacon at a lighthouse, located a perpendicular distance of 315 m from point R on a straight shoreline, revolves at 1 revolution / minute. How fast does the beam of light sweep along the shoreline at point S located on the shoreline 425 m from point R?

> Let the distance that the beam has swept from point R be $x$ m. Let the angle between the perpendicular to point R and the beam be $\theta$. The elapsed time $t$ in seconds is measured from the moment the beams hits point R where $\frac{\displaystyle d\theta}{\displaystyle dt} = 2\pi$ radians/minute and we are looking to determine $\frac{\displaystyle dx}{\displaystyle dt}$.

> To determine $\sec^2 \theta$ we can either use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine the distance between the beacon and point S (the length of the hypotenuse) and use the identity $\sec^2 \theta = \frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle \sin^2 \theta}$ or, alternatively, we can divide the [[Pythagorean Identity]] $\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1$ by $\cos^2 \theta$ as follows

\frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} + \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}

\tan^2 \theta +1 = \sec^2 \theta

\frac{dx}{dt} = 630\pi \left[\left(\frac{\displaystyle 425}{\displaystyle 315}\right)^2 +1\right] = 5582 \mbox{m}/\mbox{min}
