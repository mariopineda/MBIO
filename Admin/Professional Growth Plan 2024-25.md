# Bootstrapping a Semantic Network Teaching Resource to Advance High School Mathematics Learning

## Mario Pineda

## Goal
The primary goal of this initiative is to develop an advanced online teaching resource for high school mathematics that uses semantic networks to restructure mathematical content for a more flexible, adaptive learning experience. By leveraging the conceptual depth of semantic networks, this project seeks to challenge and redefine traditional approaches in mathematics education, overcoming the doldrums of traditional math learning, making learning both more accessible and more integrative through an innovative framework that allows students to navigate complex ideas with ease.
## Alignment with Teaching Quality Standards (TQS)
This initiative aligns closely with Alberta’s Teaching Quality Standards (TQS), as it challenges and expands conventional pedagogy:
- **Standard 2: Professional Knowledge** – By enlisting state of the art  methodologies for representing knowledge, including knowledge networks and concept-based structuring, this resource seeks to deepen students’ conceptual understanding of mathematics, aligning with standards for high-quality teaching (Alberta Education, 2010).
- **Standard 4: Establishing Inclusive Learning Environments** – The networked format will facilitate individualized learning pathways, accommodating diverse cognitive needs and fostering an inclusive educational environment  (Tomlinson, 2014).
## Rationale: The Need for a Paradigm Shift
The principles guiding traditional high school mathematics pedagogy are grounded in outdated models, which structure learning in rigid, linear sequences primarily optimized for print media, rather than for the learner. This conventional approach fails to reflect cognitive diversity and the real-time adaptability required by today’s learners, often hindering comprehension and application of mathematical concepts. In a digital era, an educational shift is needed—a Kuhnian paradigm shift akin to Thomas Kuhn’s theories, which radically transformed scientific thought. Semantic networks offer the pedagogical flexibility required for such a paradigm shift, allowing students to traverse interconnected ideas naturally, building knowledge networks that can expand intuitively and non-linearly.
## Core Concepts and Theoretical Foundation
### Semantic Networks
Semantic networks provide a dynamic framework that reflects the interrelated nature of mathematical concepts, as described by John F. Sowa’s foundational work on semantic structures. Unlike linear progressions, semantic networks structure information in a way that allows learners to absorb new concepts in digestible pieces, understand their implications, and trace their foundational elements. This modular approach supports cognitive bootstrapping, whereby students can incrementally build understanding from simpler to more complex ideas without being confined to a rigid order of progression.

Garett Lisi's  ground breaking implementation of a semantic network in his "Deferential Geometry" open science project provides an early example of an innovative framework for structuring and connecting mathematical concepts, making complex topics more intuitive through visual and relational organization. This approach could serve as an excellent foundation for an online semantic network teaching resource tailored to high school mathematics. By implementing a semantic network, fundamental concepts in algebra, geometry, calculus, and trigonometry could be linked in an interconnected web, allowing students to explore topics dynamically and understand how ideas build on and relate to one another. For instance, connecting _Trigonometric Identities_ to _Algebra_ can highlight the algebraic manipulation in trigonometry, reflect their interdependencies, providing students with a big-picture understanding of mathematics and how each topic fits within the discipline, effectively guiding them through personalized learning journeys. By engaging students in a relational learning model, this resource could deepen comprehension, promote curiosity, and enable students to grasp the interconnected nature of mathematics, ultimately supporting more meaningful and long-lasting learning.

# Implementation
The implementation of this professional growth plan leverages Markdown and LaTeX for rapid and agile prototyping of accessible and precise content formatting, utilizing Obsidian’s non-linear note-taking for semantic knowledge management. Git, combined with GitHub, serves as the backbone for version control and open-source development, allowing continuous collaboration and transparent versioning. By hosting the resource openly on GitHub, the project fosters a “Bazaar” model, as outlined in Eric S. Raymond’s _The Cathedral and the Bazaar_. This model contrasts with closed, hierarchical development ("The Cathedral") by promoting a collaborative, iterative, and modular approach, where contributions from educators, students, and developers refine the resource. GitHub’s issue tracking, pull requests, and forking capabilities enable a distributed network of contributors to improve and scale the project efficiently. This model encourages diverse insights, adaptability, and faster iterations, vital in creating a dynamic, responsive educational tool, fostering continuous improvement, and reinforcing the flexibility intrinsic to semantic network design.

**Wellness Goal:  Reclaiming the Ephemeral Lunch Hour**
In the midst of the day’s relentless march of impeding deadlines, mundane tasks and endless routines, there lies a hidden hour—a fleeting pause, rare as starlight glimpsed through clouds. This hour is the lunch hour, often lost to urgency and claimed by mundanity and haste, but I seek to reclaim it, to transform it into an hour of art, an hour of vision. I take to the city streets with a camera, seeking not the polished, the pristine, but rather the quiet mysteries that linger in forgotten spaces: the alleyways, the backstreets, the shadowed parkades where secrets dwell in silence.

There, among the grit and wear, beauty reveals itself, ephemeral as morning mist. Rusted doors and cracked pavements, stray graffiti brushed by the hand of time, light slanting like whispers through a broken window—these fragments of the city’s soul pulse with stories, if one dares to see them. With each photograph, I honor what is momentary and delicate, a fleeting sigh in the city’s breath. 

The goal, then, is simple and yet profound: to document and give voice to what is seldom noticed, to capture what slips away as soon as it is found. In this hour reclaimed, I create a space for stillness, for wonder, for finding beauty that resides in the raw and unpolished. Through the lens, I weave an homage to what is gritty, transient, and achingly beautiful, waiting to be seen.
