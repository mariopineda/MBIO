# Missed Exams Class Policy
Exams are only administered when they are scheduled. Late-writes or alternate dates are not available. Students that miss an entire exam will be awarded a zero as a mark on the exam. Students that miss one part of the exam will be awarded a mark based on the part they wrote, out of the total for both parts. Students may use the replacement exam to replace the mark for a missing exam. See class schedule for when the replacement exam is scheduled.
